# SchemeInterpreter

A scheme interpreter written in C

Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp programming language. This interpreter, developed for Clark University's CSCI 180 course, can take in a standard scheme function and compute it by printing out the resulting scheme line. The interpreter is not totally complete, but can handle the majority of basic scheme functions by recognizing which data types of present, from numbers, symbols, booleans, strings, characters, and parentheses. This interpreter is written in the C programming language and created by Ezekiel Palmer.
